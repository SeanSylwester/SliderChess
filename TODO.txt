options to change game rules (chat controls for now?)
    can you move a tile with enemy pieces
        if so, can you move a tile "through check" i.e. such that if you only moved 1 of 2 squares, you'd be in check?
    can you move a tile with a king on it
    does moving the king/rook with tiles stop you from castling, even if you move it back? (right now it doesn't)
    can you move a tile with a piece that's giving check? (I forgot to implement this)
    can you double-move a pawn that gets moved onto the home row by a tile move
promotions choose piece other than queen
surrender button
createGame dialog box
detect timer running out

server-side valid move checking
server-side confirmation of checkmate/stalemate
    then I'd only need to check for any valid moves when the client requests it, instead of every single move
add password protection to servers
